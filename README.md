Predicting maize yield using satellite and environmental data).
# ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance and Visual Insights

The following visualizations summarize the performance and interpretability of the maize yield prediction models.  
They highlight key relationships between environmental factors, vegetation indices (NDVI/EVI), and maize yield outcomes across Kenyan counties.  
These visuals provide evidence of model improvement, data distribution patterns, and the dominant predictors driving yield variability.
