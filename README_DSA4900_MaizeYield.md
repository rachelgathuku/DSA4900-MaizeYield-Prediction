# ðŸŒ¾ Maize Yield Prediction using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project investigates maize yield prediction across major Kenyan counties using satellite-derived indices and meteorological variables. The goal is to evaluate how remote-sensing and climate data can improve the accuracy of yield forecasts, helping inform agricultural planning and food-security strategies.

The study compares a baseline Linear Regression model with an improved Random Forest (RF) model using multi-source environmental data, including NDVI, EVI, rainfall, temperature, and humidity. The models are evaluated on performance metrics such as RÂ², RMSE, and MAE.

## Objectives
- Integrate agroclimatic and vegetation data for maize yield modeling.  
- Compare the predictive accuracy of statistical and machine learning methods.  
- Identify the most influential environmental factors driving yield variability.  
- Visualize spatial yield variability across counties in Kenya.  

## Methodology Summary
1. **Data Sources**
   - **FAOSTAT**: Historical yield data for maize (2010â€“2024).  
   - **NASA POWER**: Climate variables (rainfall, temperature, humidity).  
   - **EOSDA**: Satellite indices (NDVI, EVI) for vegetation health.  

2. **Modeling**
   - **Baseline**: Linear Regression.  
   - **Improved Model**: Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning.  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  

## Key Results
| Model | RÂ² | RMSE | MAE |
|-------|----|------|-----|
| Linear Regression | -0.25 | 0.18 | 0.15 |
| Random Forest | -0.05 | 0.16 | 0.14 |

- Humidity and NDVI were found to be the strongest predictors of maize yield.  
- The Random Forest model outperformed the baseline Linear Regression model slightly, showing better generalization.  
- Yield variability was most pronounced in Nairobi and Machakos counties.
